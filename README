"Put a bird on it"

This is a simple bookmarklet that replaces all the images on a webpage with whatever image you specify.

To substitute your own image just replace the 'pic' variable with your own link to an image.

To install the bookmarklet, minify all the code and add it to the link URL section of a bookmark.
